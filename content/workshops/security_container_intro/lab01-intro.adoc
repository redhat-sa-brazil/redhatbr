This lab session is a low-level, hands-on introduction to container security using the container tools included with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. It is intended to be consumed as a series of self paced exercises.

.Prerequisites
* An introductory knowledge of Linux and containers is helpful.
* Basic text editing skills using `vim` or `nano`.

== Important 

TIP: These servers can not be rebuilt in a timely fashion.

.TIPS
* Do not `rm` any files or directories you did not create.
* Make a backup copy before modifying any file.  

=== Conventions used in this lab 

Shells and Prompts

.Bastion
[source,bash]
----
ec2-user  ~ 
----

.Example `*command*` with `sample output`.
[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----
....
Red Hat Enterprise Linux release 8.1 (Ootpa)
....

=== Getting access to the servers

Use the web console to login to the bastion:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdnrev "https://" "bastion" ":9090/system/terminal" >}}
----

==== Use `ssh` to login to the nodes, from the bastion:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdnrev "ssh " "node1" "" >}}
{{< urifqdnrev "ssh " "node2" "" >}}
----

For each node, you will be asked to confirm that the key fingerprint is OK, as you haven't logged into it, before.

Node 1:

....
The authenticity of host '{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}} (10.0.2.128)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:X6KOWD5YgDqcGxnSKDgT0ZYWqBeG8yw9CKTvgFwT6sQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
....

Respond with `yes` or `y` to accept the key:

[source,bash]
----
yes
----

Logout when done.

Node 2:

....
The authenticity of host '{{< urifqdnrev "" "node2" "" >}} (10.0.2.125)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:n2/LxFOXS2of8osIEcY/5911N6OmqaJJpsYRgnVrsiA.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
....

Again, respond with `yes` or `y` to accept the key:

[source,bash]
----
yes
----

Logout when done.

Now, let's move on to lab #2!
