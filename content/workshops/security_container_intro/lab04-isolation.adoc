Containers provide a certain degree of process isolation via kernel namespaces. In this module, we’ll examine the capabilities of a process running in a containerized namespace. Specifically we'll look at how Linux capabilities can be used to grant a particular or subset of root privileges to a process running in a container. 

It would be worth taking a few minutes to read this http://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/10/17/secure-your-containers-with-this-one-weird-trick[blog post] before beginning this lab. 

== Capabilities

Capabilities are distinct units of privilege that can be independently enabled or disabled.

Start by examining the Linux process capabilities header file. 
[source,bash]
----
vim -R /usr/include/linux/capability.h
----

Turn on **line numbering** in vim.
[source,bash]
----
:set number
----

The capability bit mask definitions begin around line 103. Each capability is defined by a bit position followed by a short description. For example, the first capability is `CAP_CHOWN` (bit 0). This capability grants permission to change the ownership of files. 

....
103 /*
104  ** POSIX-draft defined capabilities.
105  **/
106 
107 /* In a system with the [_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED] option defined, this
108    overrides the restriction of changing file ownership and group
109    ownership. */
110 
111 #define CAP_CHOWN            0
....

Exit vim:
[source,bash]
----
:q
----

Now examine the capabilities bit mask of a *rootless* process running on the host. 
[source,bash]
----
grep CapEff /proc/self/status
----
....
CapEff:	0000000000000000
....
The bitmask returned is `0x0` meaning this process does not have any capabilities. For example, since bit 0 is not set (`CAP_CHOWN`) a process with this `CapEff` bitmask can not execute `chown` or `chgrp` on a file that it does not own.

Now examine the capabilities bit mask of a *root* process on the host.
[source,bash]
----
sudo grep CapEff /proc/self/status
----
....
CapEff:	000000ffffffffff
....

Notice that all 38 capability bits are set indicating this process has a full set of capabilities. In a later exercise, you'll discover that a container
running as **root** has a filtered set of capabilities by default but this can be changed at run time.

The `capsh` command can decode a capabilities bitmask into a human readable output. Try it out!
[source,bash]
----
capsh --decode=ffffffffff
----
....
0x000000ffffffffff=cap_chown,cap_dac_override,cap_dac_read_search,cap_fowner,cap_fsetid,cap_kill,cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_setpcap,cap_linux_immutable,cap_net_bind_service,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_chroot,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_mknod,cap_lease,cap_audit_write,cap_audit_control,cap_setfcap,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read,38,39
....

*NOTE: for those interested, capability '38' allows the following:*
....
* CAP_PERFMON relaxes the verifier checks further:
 * - BPF progs can use of pointer-to-integer conversions
 * - speculation attack hardening measures are bypassed
 * - bpf_probe_read to read arbitrary kernel memory is allowed
 * - bpf_trace_printk to print kernel memory is allowed
....

*NOTE: for those interested, capability '39' allows the following:*
....
 * CAP_BPF allows the following BPF operations:
 * - Creating all types of BPF maps
 * - Advanced verifier features
 *   - Indirect variable access
 *   - Bounded loops
 *   - BPF to BPF function calls
 *   - Scalar precision tracking
 *   - Larger complexity limits
 *   - Dead code elimination
 *   - And potentially other features
 * - Loading BPF Type Format (BTF) data
 * - Retrieve xlated and JITed code of BPF programs
 * - Use bpf_spin_lock() helper
....

In comparison, '200' indicates the immutable capability (CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE):

[source,bash]
----
capsh --decode=200
----
....
0x0000000000000200=cap_linux_immutable
....

=== Exploring the capabilities of containers.

A non-null CapEff value indicates the process has some capabilities. You will discover that the capabilities of a container are often less than what a root process has running on the host.

Start by running a rootless container as `--user=32767` and look at it’s capabilities.
[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -it --user=32767 registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi grep CapEff /proc/self/status
----
....
CapEff:	0000000000000000
....

Next run a rootless container as `--user=0` and look at it’s capabilities. Note that it's capabilities are filtered from that of a root process on the host.
[source,bash]
----
podman run --user=0 --rm -it registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi grep CapEff /proc/self/status
----
....
CapEff:	00000000a80425fb
....

Now run a container as privileged and compare the results to the previous exercises. What conclusions can you draw?
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --user=0 --rm -it --privileged registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi grep CapEff /proc/self/status
----
....
CapEff: 000000ffffffffff
....

=== Examining container processes

Run a container in the background that runs for a few minutes.
[source,bash]
----
podman run --user=0 --name=sleepy -it -d registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi sleep 999
----

Use `podman top` to examine the container's capabilities.
[source,bash]
----
podman top sleepy capeff
----
....
EFFECTIVE CAPS
AUDIT_WRITE,CHOWN,DAC_OVERRIDE,FOWNER,FSETID,KILL,MKNOD,NET_BIND_SERVICE,NET_RAW,SETFCAP,SETGID,SETPCAP,SETUID,SYS_CHROOT
....

Try out the following very useful shortcut (`-l`). It tells `podman` to act on the latest container it is aware of:
[source,bash]
----
podman top -l capeff
----

Podman `top` has many additional format descriptors you can check out.
[source,bash]
----
podman top -h
----

=== Capabilities Challenge #1

How could you determine which capabilities podman _filters_ from a _root_ process running in a container? 

From a previous exercise we know that a root process on the host has a capabilities mask of CapEff = `000000ffffffffff`

From a previous exercise we know that a root process in a container has a capabilities mask of CapEff = `00000000a80427fb`

Hint: Below is an example that uses the Linux binary calculator `bc` to add hexadecimal numbers `(0x9 + 0x1) = A`.
[source,bash]
----
sudo yum install bc -y
echo 'obase=16;ibase=16;9+1' | bc
----
....
A
....
=== Capabilities Challenge #2

Suppose an application had a legitimate reason to change the date (ntpd, license testing, etc) How would you allow a container to change the date on the host? What capabilities are needed to allow this? 

Run a container, save the date then try to change the date.
[source,bash]
----
podman run --rm -ti --user 0 --name temp registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi bash
savethedate=$(date)
date -s "$savethedate"
----
....
date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted
Mon Apr  8 21:45:24 UTC 2019
....

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

=== Capabilities Challenge #3

You have been given a container image to deploy (`quay.io/bkozdemb/hello`). The application needs to use the `chattr` utility but must not be allowed to `ping` any hosts. Use what you've learned about capabilities to properly deploy this application using `podman`.

For example, `ping` succeeds but `chattr` fails. We want the opposite.  
[source,bash]
----
podman run -it --name=chattr_no_ping --rm quay.io/bkozdemb/utils bash
ping -c1 127.0.0.1
----
....
PING 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 127.0.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.035 ms

--- 127.0.0.1 ping statistics ---
1 packets transmitted, 1 received, 0% packet loss, time 0ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.035/0.035/0.035/0.000 ms
....
[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
touch file
chattr +i file
----
....
chattr: Operation not permitted while setting flags on file
....

Exit from the container:

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

=== Example Solutions to Challenges

Challenge #1: One approach would be to use your favorite binary calculator (`bc`) to calculate the difference in `CapEff` between a host root process `(0xffffffffff)` and a containerized root process `(0xa80427fb)`.
....
  0xFFFFFFFFFF
- 0x00A80427FB
  ------------
  0xFF57FBD804
....
[source,bash]
----
echo 'obase=16;ibase=16;FFFFFFFFFF-A80427FB' | bc
----
....
FF57FBD804
....

To produce a human readable list, use `capsh` to decode the vector.
[source,bash]
----
capsh --decode=FF57FBD804
----
....
0x000000ff57fbd804=cap_dac_read_search,cap_net_broadcast,cap_net_admin,cap_ipc_lock,cap_ipc_owner,cap_sys_module,cap_sys_rawio,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_pacct,cap_sys_admin,cap_sys_boot,cap_sys_nice,cap_sys_resource,cap_sys_time,cap_sys_tty_config,cap_lease,cap_audit_control,cap_mac_override,cap_mac_admin,cap_syslog,cap_wake_alarm,cap_block_suspend,cap_audit_read,38,39
....

Challenge #2: To allow a container to set the system clock, the `sys_time` capability must be added. Add this capability then try setting the date again.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --rm -ti --user 0 --name temp --cap-add=sys_time registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi bash
savethedate=$(date)
date -s "$savethedate"
----
....
Mon Apr  8 21:46:18 UTC 2019
....
And exit from the container:
[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Challenge #3: Drop all capabilities then add `linux_immutable`. The trick with this is the container must run as root because `linux_immutable` is a filtered capability.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run -it --name=chattr_no_ping --rm --cap-drop=all --cap-add=linux_immutable quay.io/bkozdemb/utils bash
----

The `chattr` command should succeed in making a file read only:
[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
touch file
chattr +i file
rm -rf file
----
....
rm: cannot remove 'file': Operation not permitted
....
[source,bash]
----
lsattr file
----
....
----i--------------- file
....

Remember to reset the file attributes so the container can shutdown cleanly:
[source,bash]
----
chattr -i file
lsattr file
----
....
-------------------- file
....

On the host, check the capabilities of the container. This will require you to open another terminal:
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman top chattr_no_ping capeff
----
....
EFFECTIVE CAPS
LINUX_IMMUTABLE
....

Exit the container (in the original container):
[source,bash]
----
exit
----
