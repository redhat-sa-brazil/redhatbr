In this lab, you will use `podman` to sign container images and create trust policies to control access to registries. 

To begin the image signing procedure, a signature claim is generated by encrypting a container image manifest using a private
gpg key. The signature claims are stored in a file system or web
server where they can be decrypted later and used to pull signed
images.

The procedure is reversed when pulling signed images.

== Configuring the signature claim store

On the bastion server, create a configuration for the `node1` registry. 

Become root to do this.
[source,bash]
----
sudo -i
----

Create the configuration for node1.
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF > /etc/containers/registries.d/{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ".yaml" >}}
----
[source,bash]
----
docker:
  {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000:" >}}
    sigstore: file:///var/tmp/sigstore/{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}
    sigstore-staging: file:///var/tmp/sigstore/{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}
EOF
----

Exit from the root shell.
[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Notice we are using the `/var/tmp/sigstore` directory to store signature claims. This allows the system administrator to configure the signature store for a given registry and allows rootless users to push and pull signed container images.

Create a directory for the signature claims for the node1 registry.
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p /usr/tmp/sigstore/{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}
----

=== Generating key pairs

Generate the gpg key pair. You'll be prompted to set a pass phrase. Set it to `1234567890` so you don't forget. :)
[source,bash]
----
gpg2 --quick-gen-key --yes ec2-user
----

Now export the public key. You'll need it later.
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /usr/tmp/keys
gpg2 --export ec2-user > /usr/tmp/keys/gpg-pubkey.gpg
----

Confirm you have a container image with the **correct REPOSITORY and TAG** as shown.
[source,bash]
----
podman tag registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora:latest" >}}
podman images
----
....
REPOSITORY                                          TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}   latest   a4a954bf99ed   2 weeks ago   184 MB
....

Login to the registry, then sign and push the image. When `podman` signs the image it will prompt for the gpg key pass phrase you used to create the key pair. It then creates a signature claim.
[source,bash]
----
podman login --username=redhat --password=redhat {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000" >}}
----
....
Login Succeeded!
....
----
podman push --sign-by ec2-user {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}
----

=== Working with trust policies

In this exercise you will configure the image trust policy so that it allows only signed images to be pulled from a trusted registry on node1. 

Start by examining the current trust policy (which accepts anything) then create a default policy that rejects all image pulls.
[source,bash]
----
podman image trust show
----
....
default             insecureAcceptAnything                         
....

Change the policy to reject by default.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman image trust set -t reject default
podman image trust show
----
....

          insecureAcceptAnything      
default   reject
....

=== Pulling signed images

Now we are ready to try an image pull. To make certain you are authenticated to the registry, login again.
[source,bash]
----
podman login --username=redhat --password=redhat {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000" >}}
----
....
Login Succeeded!
....

Now test that image pulls are rejected by default.
[source,bash]
----
podman pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}
----
....
Trying to pull {{< urifqdnrev "https://" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}...
  Running image {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest:latest" >}} is rejected by policy.
Error: error pulling image "{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}": unable to pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest:" >}} unable to pull image: Source image rejected: Running image {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest:latest" >}} is rejected by policy.
....

Set a trust policy for `{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}` using your exported public gpg key.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman image trust set --type signedBy --pubkeysfile /usr/tmp/keys/gpg-pubkey.gpg {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000" >}}
----

Now examine the image trust again. It should show that any image pulls from *node1.{GUID}.internal* must be signed.
[source,bash]
----
podman image trust show
----
....
default                      reject                              
{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000" >}}   signedBy                 ec2-user   file:///var/tmp/sigstore/{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}
....

Finally, try to pull the image from the trusted registry on `{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" "" >}}` and it should succeed.
[source,bash]
----
podman pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}
----
....
Trying to pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}...

=== Create a trust policy for Red Hat images. 

In this exercise, you will create a trust policy that allows only signed images to be pulled from Red Hat's Container Catalog.  

First, try a pull and it should fail because of the default policy.
[source,bash]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----
....
Trying to pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi...
  Running image docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by policy.
Error: error pulling image "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi": unable to pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi: unable to pull image: Source image rejected: Running image docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest is rejected by policy.
....

Configure the sigstore for the RedHat registry.

Become root to do this.
[source,bash]
----
sudo -i
----

Create the configuration for node1.
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF > /etc/containers/registries.d/registry.access.redhat.com.yaml
----
[source,bash]
----
docker:
     registry.access.redhat.com:
         sigstore: https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
EOF
----

Exit from the root shell.
[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Configure the trust policy for the RedHat registry.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman image trust set -f /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release registry.access.redhat.com
----

Examine the trust policy again.
[source,bash]
----
podman image trust show
----
....
default                              reject
registry.access.redhat.com           signedBy                security@redhat.com, security@redhat.com  https://access.redhat.com/webassets/docker/content/sigstore
{{< urifqdnrev "" "node1" ":5000" >}}  signedBy                ec2-user                                  file:///var/tmp/sigstore/node1-0.jajcontainer.rhnaps.io
                                     insecureAcceptAnything
....

Try the image pull again.
[source,bash]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----
....

=== Blocking a registry

It is recommended that a registry trust policy be used to control which registries you want to allow users to pull and push from. This gives greater flexibility, and supports all container runtimes and tools including the docker daemon, podman, buildah and cri-o.

There are a few ways to approach this:

* Create a default reject policy and trust only node1
* Create a default accept policy and reject node2

Take what you've learned and give each a try.

Now try to pull the image from `{{< urifqdnrev "" "node2" "" >}}`, it should fail.
[source,bash]
----
podman pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}
----
....
Trying to pull {{< urifqdnrev "https://" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}...
  Running image {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest:latest" >}} is rejected by policy.
Error: error pulling image "{{< urifqdnrev "" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}": unable to pull {{< urifqdnrev "" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest:" >}} unable to pull image: Source image rejected: Running image {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest:latest" >}} is rejected by policy.
