Container images can easily be pulled from any public registry and run on a container host but is this good practice? Can you trust this image and what are its contents? A better practice would be to inspect the image before running it. 

== Podman inspect

Use `podman` to inspect the *registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi* image. Remember, this image must be present in local storage. Examine the output to determine who is the maintainer and what is the version of that image?

[source,bash]
----
podman inspect registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----

=== Podman diff

The `podman diff` command can help understand the difference between a container image and its parent. 
[source,bash]
----
podman diff --format=json registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----

=== Podman live mounts

Next we’ll use the podman command to inspect a container’s filesystem by mounting it to the host.

First, launch a long running container in the background.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run -d --name sleepy registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi sleep 9999
----
....
7ce0fdb9d8a9345e760fbcbf460d795a0a50cba1ac6e0ffe0e894c7a927cdcda
....

Next, enter the container's namespace, create some data then `exit` back to the host.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman exec -it sleepy bash
----
The previous `podman` command will give you a shell within the container shell.  Now, create some data:
[source,bash]
----
date >> /tmp/date.txt
exit
----

Next, mount the container. The host mount point should get displayed.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman mount sleepy
----

....
/var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/<container-id>/merged
....

Using the directory returned from the above `mount` command, confirm the date.txt file exists in the mounted file system.
[source,bash]
----
export MOUNTED=`sudo ls -tr /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay | tail -2 | grep -v backingFsBlockDev`
sudo cat /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/$MOUNTED/merged/tmp/date.txt
----
....
Tue Apr 16 19:45:11 UTC 2019
....

How might you search this container's file system for all programs that are owned by root and have the SETUID bit set?
[source,bash]
----
sudo find /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/$MOUNTED/merged -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;
----
....
-rws--x--x. 1 root root 47424 Nov 20  2018 /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/c1add9d7
571f099af67704bea5774efaa3df3351d8ccafc60dc0678e91e5ff5c/merged/usr/sbin/userhelper
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 13376 Dec  7  2018 /var/lib/containers/storage/overlay/c1add9d7
571f099af67704bea5774efaa3df3351d8ccafc60dc0678e91e5ff5c/merged/usr/sbin/pam_timestamp_
check

...
...
...
....

Un-mount the container when you're finished.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman umount sleepy
----
....
<container-id>
....

Stop and remove the running container.
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman stop sleepy
sudo podman rm sleepy
----

=== Working with Skopeo

Skopeo is an additional low level tool that can perform image operations on local or remote images. Give the examples below a try.  

=== Inspecting images

Try the following `skopeo` commands to inspect images from a remote registry. How
many layers does the `ubi` image contain? 

Try to inspect an image in local container storage. What command did you use?
[source,bash]
----
skopeo inspect docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
----
....
{
    "Name": "registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi",
    "Digest": "sha256:1f0e6e1f451ff020b3b44c1c4c34d85db5ffa0fc1bb0490d6a32957a7a06b67f"
,
    "RepoTags": [
        "8.1",
        ...
        ...
        ...

}
....

Skopeo can also copy images between two registries. See the `skopeo(1)` man page for details and give it a try. An example is shown below. To make this work, the proper image tags must exist and authentication to registries must be in place.
[source,bash]
----
skopeo copy {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node1" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}} {{< urifqdnrev "docker://" "node2" ":5000/fedora/latest" >}}
