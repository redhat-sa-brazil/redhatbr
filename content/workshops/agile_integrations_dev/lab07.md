## Overview

The focal point of your developersâ€™ experience is the API developer portal, and the level of effort you put into it will determine the level of decreased support costs and increased developer engagement.

### Why Red Hat?

3scale provides a built-in, state-of-the-art CMS portal, making it very easy to create your own branded hub with a custom domain to manage developer interactions and increase API adoption.

You can customize the look and feel of the entire Developer Portal to match your own branding. You have complete control over every element of the portal, so you can make it as easy as possible for developers to learn how to use your API.

## Notes and Further Reading

Red Hat 3scale Developer Portal's CMS consists of a few elements:

* Horizontal menu in the Admin Portal with access to content, redirects, and changes
* The main area containing details of the sections above
* CMS mode, accessible through the preview option

[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid) is a simple programming language used for displaying and processing most of the data from the 3scale system available for API providers. In 3scale, it is used to expose server-side data to your API developers, greatly extending the usefulness of the CMS while maintaining a high level of security.
