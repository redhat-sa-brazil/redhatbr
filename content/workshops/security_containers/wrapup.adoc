= Wrap Up

That wraps up what we have planned for today.  We hope you've learned something
valuable about Container Security that you can apply in your daily role.

What do you think? How can we help you understand Container Security better?

Before you leave, check out the *Resources* page that is part of this guide.
There you can find a ton of links that will further your Container education.

This *Participant Guide* will remain active for the next two weeks.  Please
take advantage of it by creating your own Container Security environment back
at your organization.

Thank you for your time and participation!
