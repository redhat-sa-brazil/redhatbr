# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the OpenStack environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how Infrastructure-as-a-Service works.

# Get even deeper

Here are some good resources to continue learning OpenStack:

* [OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/)
* [RDO Project - Our midstream, open source OpenStack distrobution for RHEL variants](https://www.rdoproject.org/)
* [Red Hat OpenStack Platform Official Docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/13/)

There are two ways to get started with RDO: TripleO Quickstart and PackStack

* [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/)
* [PackStack](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/)

With Red Hat OpenStack Platform, you can use our Quick Start Guide or Packstack
