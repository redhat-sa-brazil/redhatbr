= Exercise 3.0 - Configure Red Hat Enterprise Linux to run containers

== Exercise Description
As part of the exercise, we are going to run a login command on the edge node to set a temporary token.  This token will allow the edge node to log into the Red Hat OpenShift registry and download containers.

As part of the exercise, we have built a playbook for you; however, no all of the variables are assigned.  This allows us to distribute the playbook to multiple workshops and you the capability to understand how to run playbooks in Ansible tower and assign custom variables to those plays.  As part of the exercise, you will create a Template within Ansible tower to run the defined playbook, set the custom variables, and define a *survey* to prompt you to enter the sensitive credential via a prompt.
