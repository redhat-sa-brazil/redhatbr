= Exercise 1.1 - Running an Ansible playbook


== Objective: Configure Edge node to run a Performance CoPilot agent


As part of this exercise, you will be running a pre-existing Ansible playbook pre-loaded into your CodeReady Workspace.  

The playbook is written to showcase a series of basic Ansible concepts.

*Note:* The following commands below need to be run from within the Ansible terminal

=== Step 1: Checking a playbook playbook for correct syntax

However, before you run the playbook, lets take a few moments to understand the options.

- *init-pcp.yml* This is the name of the playbook that we are running.
- *-v* Altough not used here, this increases verbosity.  Try running your playbook a second time using `-v` or `-vv` to increase the verbosity (debugging information).


[NOTE]
- *--syntax-check* If you run into any issues with your playbook running properly (from the copy/pasting that we told you not to do), you could use this option to help find those issues like so...



Go to your playbook directory ( `~/edge` ), and run a syntax check of your playbook:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/edge
ansible-playbook init-pcp.yml --syntax-check
----

Now, let's look at the playbook by selecting it from the file list on the left.

Based on the above, let's run the playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook init-pcp.yml
----
