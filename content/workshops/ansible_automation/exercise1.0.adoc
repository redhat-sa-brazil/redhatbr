= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad Hoc Commands


== Exercise Description

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Red Hat Ansible Automation works.  Ansible ad hoc commands enable you to perform repeatable tasks on local or remote nodes, without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two tasks quickly and often, to many remote nodes.

== Quick example:

Let's deploy an application on your local node that can assist you with the workshop.  Using ad hoc commands, we will download a configuration file from a remote git server (gitOps), set up a system service, and start the service.

====
[NOTE]
The service will be a Visual Studio Code container, defined in a Kubernetes POD YAML, launched via podman by systemd.
====

The systemd configuration file exists in SCM; so, we need to pull it to the local host.  Since the file is available via a URL, we will use the Ansible *uri* module to retrieve the file.

The ansible ad hoc command will start with *ansible*, then the target, declaring the *uri* module via the *--module* switch, the arguments *--args* to the module, followed by the *--become* switch telling Ansible to become a superuser.  

====
[NOTE]
We have configured 'sudo' for you; however, Ansible can use lots of other methods to become (-b) the superuser. 
====

[source,bash]
----
ansible localhost --module-name uri --args "url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.workshops/master/ansible_tower_aws/files/code-server.service return_content=yes dest=/etc/systemd/system" --become
----

Now in the */etc/systemd/system* directory lives the *code-server.service* file you downloaded from the SCM system. In order to apply it, we would typically utilize the *systemctl* command; however, this is an Ansible workshop.  With that being said, we will apply the configuration file with a module. 

[source,bash]
----
ansible localhost --module-name service --args "name=code-server state=started enabled=yes" --become
----

It is possible now to see your service running by doing the following commands:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status code-server.service
----

Additionally, you can see more details about the pod deployment:

[source,bash]
----
podman pod list
----

Connect to the web based editor in a browser window, using the following URL:

[source,bash]
----
{{< uriwildfqdn "https://" "tower" ":8443" >}}
----

=== Managing remote hosts

First, in order to manage remote systems - we need to set up our dependencies:

Define your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible, as they define remote machines on which you will run commands or your playbook(s).  Use `vi` or `vim` to create a file called `hosts`.  Then, add the appropriate definitions for the node that will function as a web node.

====
[NOTE]
The *workshopname*, in the example below, will be provided to you by your instructor.  The *#* should be replaced by your student number.

For example, a recent workshop student used:
*{{< urifqdn "" "tower" "" >}}*
====

.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
vim hosts
----

Put the following content into the file:

....
[web]
{{< uriwildfqdn "" "node" "" >}}
....

=== Step 1: Test webhost response

Let's start with something basic - pinging a host.  The `ping` module tests the responsiveness of our web host.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web --module-name ping
----

=== Step 2: Run a Linux command

Now let's see how we can run a Linux command and format the output, using the `command` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web --module-name command --args "uptime" --one-line
----

=== Step 3: Review the setup module

Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The `setup` module displays Ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web --module-name setup
----


====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, *ansible* allows for long-form and short-form command-line arguments.  For example:

[source,bash]
----
ansible web --module-name command --args "uptime" --one-line --become
----
The command above is the same as running the command below:
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o -b
----

We are going to be using the short-form options, going forward. Please ask your instructor if any of them are unclear!

====

=== Step 4: Install Node.js

Now, let's install Node.js, using the `dnf` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=nodejs state=present" -b
----

=== Step 5: Let's copy a file to the managed node.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m copy -a "src=hello.js dest=hello.js"
----

=== Step 6: Copy configuration file to priviledged location

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m copy -a "src=hello.service dest=/etc/systemd/system/hello.service" -b
----

=== Step 6: Deploy an application

Next, we will deploy an application. We first enable the application service, then open the port in the firewall, and last activate the change to the firewall: 

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=hello state=started enabled=yes" -b
ansible web -m firewalld -a "port=8080/tcp permanent=yes state=enabled" -b
ansible web -m systemd -a "name=firewalld state=reloaded" -b
----

Demo site (unit test):
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m uri -a "url=http://localhost:8080 return_content=yes"
ansible localhost -m uri -a "url={{< uriwildfqdn "" "node" "" >}}:8080 return_content=yes"
----

Demo site (open this in your web browser):
[source,bash]
----
{{< uriwildfqdn "http://" "node" "" >}}:8080
----

=== Step 7: Cleanup

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the node service, using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=hello state=stopped enabled=no" -b
----

=== Step 8: Remove package

Next, remove the nodejs package, as shown, below:

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m dnf -a "name=nodejs state=absent" -b
----

=== Step 9: Clean files

Last, let's remove the web content and service definition:

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m file -a "path=/home/ec2-user/hello.js state=absent"
ansible web -m file -a "path=/etc/systemd/system/hello.service state=absent" -b
----
