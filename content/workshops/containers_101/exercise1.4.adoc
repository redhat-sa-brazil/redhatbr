= Exercise 1.4 - Working with a Container Registry

== Exercise 1.4 - Working with a Container Registry

== Exercise Description

In this exercise, you will learn container registry basics, what the registry offers and how to use it.

_What is container registry?_

A basic container registry is a stateless, highly scalable server side application that stores and  distributes container images.  The docker registry is an open-source project offered under the permissive Apache license.


_Why use container registries?_

You should use a private container registry if you want to:

- tightly control where your images are being stored
- fully own your image's distribution pipeline
- integrate image storage and distribution tightly into your in-house development workflow

=== Step 1. Install docker-distribution package

First, lets install the `docker-distribution` package, to provide the registry software:

[source, bash]
----
yum install -y docker-distribution
----

=== Step 2. Set the service to auto-start

Next, lets set the service to auto-start at system boot:

[source, bash]
----
systemctl enable docker-distribution
----

=== Step 3. Enable use of https

A) The container registry configuration file will need to be modified to allow the use of https (secure) communications.  First, we will generate a certificate.

[source, bash]
----
mkdir /etc/docker-distribution/certs
----

[source, bash]
----
cd /etc/docker-distribution/certs
----

[source, bash]
----
openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -sha256 -keyout domain.key -x509 -days 365 -out domain.crt
----


B) Answer the questions that OpenSSL asks, in any way that you see fit, but make sure that you specify a `Common Name` of `localhost`.  Here is an example:

....
Generating a 4096 bit RSA private key
............................................................++
...............................................................++
writing new private key to 'domain.key'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:Ohio
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Dublin
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:workshop
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:workshop
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []:localhost
Email Address []:student@lab.local
....

=== Step 4. To finish this configuration,  add the cert to the system's trusted database:

[source, bash]
----
cp domain.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs
----

[source, bash]
----
update-ca-trust extract
----

=== Step 5. Add secure mode to the container registry configuration.

Edit the file '/etc/docker-distribution/registry/config.yml' to match the example below.  Pay close attention to the last five lines, starting with tls, as these are required for configuration file.

[source, bash]
----
vi /etc/docker-distribution/registry/config.yml
----

[source, bash]
----
version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry
storage:
    cache:
        layerinfo: inmemory
    filesystem:
        rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
    delete:
        enabled: true
http:
    addr: :5000
    tls:
      certificate: /etc/docker-distribution/certs/domain.crt
      key: /etc/docker-distribution/certs/domain.key
    host: https://localhost:5000
    relativeurls: false
----


=== Step 6. Start the registry:

.Start the registry
[source, bash]
----
systemctl start docker-distribution
----

=== Step 7. View images in the local image database.

Before we upload anything, let's take a look to see what images we have in the local image database:

[source, bash]
----
podman images
----
....
REPOSITORY                            TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7      latest   7a840db7f020   2 days ago       211MB
docker.io/library/fedora              latest   cc510acfcd70   2 weeks ago      263MB
docker.io/library/fedora_postgresql   latest   b105a704d05d   10 minutes ago   495MB
....

=== Step 8. Push the container to the local registry.

To push the container, either of these two commands will work.

[IMPORTANT]
Choose only one of the following two commands (`buildah push` or `skopeo copy`).  Both accomplish the same purpose.

[source, bash]
----
buildah push fedora_postgresql:latest localhost:5000/fedora_postgresql:latest
----

With Skopeo, we need to be a bit more specific, and specify the image ID that we saw, above, from `podman images`.
[NOTE]
This image ID will vary, and you should use the value from the output produced on your workshop instance:

[source, bash]
----
skopeo copy containers-storage:7a840db7f020 docker://localhost:5000/fedora_postgresql:latest
----

=== Step 9. Verify the image location in the registry.

Next, let's search the registry to make sure that our image made it, and is available:

[source, bash]
----
podman search localhost:5000/postgresql
----
....
INDEX            NAME                               DESCRIPTION   STARS   OFFICIAL   AUTOMATED
localhost:5000   localhost:5000/fedora_postgresql                 0
....
