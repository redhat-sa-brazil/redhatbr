= Containers 101 Workshop

== Workshop Description

This workshop will introduce you to Linux containers and provide you with foundational container hands-on training.

== Who should attend
Today's container workshop is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Linux containers, whether you have used it or not.

== What you will learn

- How to install docker, buildah, podman, and skopeo
- How to run an existing container image
- How to build a new container from a base container image
- How to push the new container image to a container registry

== Overview

This workshop will start with a short overview about containers and instructions on setting up for the Container 101 Workshop. Next, we will transition into hands-on exercises. We will spend most of our time showing you how to work with container images, Dockerfiles, and container registries.

== Your Responsibilities

Have a discussion. This will be boring if itâ€™s just us talking for over two hours.

Participate, by offering questions and sharing opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy to follow along.
