= Exercise 1.0 - Deploy OpenShift

image::openshift-ocp.svg[]

OpenShift v3 is a layered system designed to expose underlying Docker-formatted
container image and Kubernetes concepts as accurately as possible, with a focus
on easy composition of applications by a developer. For example, install Ruby,
push code, and add MySQL.

== OpenShift

=== Step 1:

*Use the `oc` command*

These instances have been preconfigured with `docker` and the `oc` command. The
`oc` command makes deploying OpenShift for development purposes incredibly
easy. The `oc cluster up` command starts a OpenShift all-in-one cluster with a
configured registry, router, image streams, and default templates.

.switch to root
[source]
----
sudo -i
----

.make a /data dir
[source]
----
mkdir /data
----

Next use the following command to bring up the cluster on your local machine.

{{% alert warning %}}
But first! export your student number to sync up with the wildcard DNS mapped
to your instance. For example below, if you are student `0` then `export
STUDENT=0`.
{{% /alert %}}

.Change the number to your student number
[source]
----
export STUDENT=0
----

.Run the oc command (you can cut & paste this)
[source]
----
oc cluster up --public-hostname=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) --routing-suffix=apps.ocp.$STUDENT.redhatgov.io --host-pv-dir=/data --host-data-dir=/data
----


.Successful Build (example)
[source,bash]
----
Using nsenter mounter for OpenShift volumes
Using public hostname IP 107.21.72.239 as the host IP
Using 107.21.72.239 as the server IP
Starting OpenShift using openshift/origin:v3.9.0 ...
OpenShift server started.
The server is accessible via web console at:
    https://107.21.72.239:8443 <1>
You are logged in as:
    User:     developer
    Password: <any value>
To login as administrator:
    oc login -u system:admin
----

<1> OpenShift Web Console, EXAMPLE: `https://107.21.72.239:8443`  or use the DNS name with your student number, Example: `https://openshiftsecurity.0.redhatgov.io:8443`


=== Step 2:

*Launch your first application.*

.see what user you are loged in as
[source]
----
oc whoami
----

You should be logged in as `developer`

Create a new
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/projects_and_users.html[Project]
for your first app.

.create new project
[source]
----
oc new-project flask --description="Python Flask App" --display-name="Flask App"
----

Now use the `new-app` command to create the new app from a simple Python flask
repository on GitHub. By using the `--strategy=source` we can pass it the type
of container to build and launch the app. In this case we are using
`python:3.5`.

.create the app
[source]
----
oc new-app --strategy=source python:3.5~https://github.com/RedHatGov/OCP-App.git --name=flask-app
----

Now follow the logs as its being built.

.follow the logs
[source]
----
oc logs -f bc/flask-app
----

*Open a browser next to the terminal so you can see the app get created*

=== Step 3:

*Login to OpenShift*

.Login as developer
[source]
----
Username:  developer

Password:  developer
----

.OpenShift Main Login
image::login-ocp.png[]

Click on the new project you created `Flask App`.

.Flask App
image::flask-app.png[]

Now we need to create a
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[`route`]
to see the app.

Click `Create Route` in the top right corner. Accept the defaults and click
`create`.

.create route
image::create-route.png[]

Now lets see your first app. Click the new route. It should look similar to
this `http://http://flask-app-flask.apps.ose.0.redhatgov.io`.

{{< panel_group >}}
{{% panel "Result!" %}}

:imagesdir: /workshops/security_openshift/images

image::ocp-result.png[]

{{% /panel %}}
{{< /panel_group >}}

Congratulations! You have launched your first app in OpenShift!

To recap:

- You just launched OpenShift on AWS
- You launched a containerized python app

== Extra credit

[TIP]
.Details on the oc command (Informational Only)
[source,bash]
----
oc cluster up \
   --public-hostname=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4) \ <1>
   --routing-suffix=apps.ocp.$STUDENT.redhatgov.io \ <2>
   --host-pv-dir=/data \ <3>
   --host-data-dir=/data  <4>
----

<1> This sets OpenShift's public name to the public ip of the AMI, via the AWS
metadata service (169.254.169.254).

<2> This sets the wildcard domain for all of the applications you provision in
OpenShift.

<3> Cluster up creates a set of persistent volumes by default. It exposes a new
flag that allows setting the directory on the host for these volumes.

<4> To persist data across restarts, specify a valid host directory when
starting your cluster with `oc` cluster up.
