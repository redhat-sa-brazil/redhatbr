= Exercise 1.3 - SELinux

image::selinux.png[]

SELinux is primarily a labeling system that assigns a label (name) to every
process and system object. This allows every aspect of kernel operations to be
first labeled, second classified, and then ultimately enforced by a set of
rules that the provider maintains.

BENEFITS OF RUNNING SELINUX

- All processes and files are labeled with a type. A type defines a domain for
processes, and a type for files. Processes are separated from each other by
running in their own domains, and SELinux policy rules define how processes
interact with files, as well as how processes interact with each other. Access
is only allowed if an SELinux policy rule exists that specifically allows it.
- Fine-grained access control. Stepping beyond traditional UNIX permissions
that are controlled at user discretion and based on Linux user and group IDs,
SELinux access decisions are based on all available information, such as an
SELinux user, role, type, and, optionally, a level.
- SELinux policy is administratively-defined, enforced system-wide, and is not
set at user discretion.
- SELinux can be used to enforce data confidentiality and integrity, as well as
protecting processes from untrusted inputs.
- Reduced vulnerability to privilege escalation attacks. SELinux policy rules
define how processes access files and other processes. If a process is
compromised, the attacker only has access to the normal functions of that
process, and to files the process has been configured to have access to.

_For example, if the Apache HTTP Server is compromised, an attacker cannot use
that process to read files in user home directories, unless a specific SELinux
policy rule was added or configured to allow such access._

== SELinux

=== Step 1:

In this section, we’ll cover the basics of SELinux and containers. SELinux
policy prevents a lot of break out situations where the other security
mechanisms fail. With SELinux on Docker, we write policy that says that the
container process running as `svirt_lxc_net_t` can only read/write files with
the `svirt_sandbox_file_t` label.

Create the following directories.

.Setup directory and file
[source,bash]
----
mkdir selinux

cd  selinux

mkdir data

echo "SELINUX" > data/file1.txt

cat data/file1.txt
----

.Get Current SELinux policy
[source,bash]
----
sestatus | grep mode
----

=== Step 2:

.Try to cat out the file (it should fail)
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora cat /data/file1.txt
----

You can see the reason by inspecting the folder’s security context:

[source,bash]
----
ls --scontext data
----

The label for the data doesn’t match the label for containers. The fix is to
apply the container label to the data by using the `chcon` tool, effectively
notifying the system that you expect these files to be consumed by containers:

Find the selinux file context associated with containers.

.Find the Containers Labels
[source,bash]
----
sudo semanage fcontext --list | grep svirt
----

The containers should be running at `svirt_sandbox_file_t`

=== Step 3:

Apply the container label to the `data` directory by using the `chcon` tool

.relable the data dir
[source,bash]
----
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t data
----

Try to cat out the file again from the container.

.run docker again
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora cat /data/file1.txt
----

What did you see?

Now try it in reverse. Append text from the container to the file

.append text
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora sh -c 'echo "REDHAT" >> /data/file1.txt'
----

.see the text you appended from the container
[source,bash]
----
cat data/file1.txt
----

== DOCKER SELINUX SECURITY POLICY

The Docker SELinux security policy is similar to the libvirt security policy
and is based on the libvirt security policy.

The libvirt security policy is a series of SELinux policies that defines two
ways of isolating virtual machines. Generally, virtual machines are prevented
from accessing parts of the network. Specifically, individual virtual machines
are denied access to one another’s resources.

Red Hat extends the libvirt-SELinux model to Docker. The Docker SELinux role
and Docker SELinux types are based on libvirt. For example, by default, Docker
has access to /usr/var/ and some other locations, but it has complete access to
things that are labeled with svirt_sandbox_file_t.

https://www.mankier.com/8/docker_selinux - this explains the entire Docker
SELinux policy. It is not in layman’s terms, but it is complete.

`svirt_sandbox_file_t`

[source,bash]
----
system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c186,c641
^      ^           ^          ^     ^--- unique category
|      |           |          |----  secret-level 0
|      |           |--- a shared type
|      |---SELinux role
|------ SELinux user
----

If a file is labeled `svirt_sandbox_file_t`, then by default all containers can
read it. But if the containers write into a directory that has
`svirt_sandbox_file_t` ownership, they write using their own category (which in
this case is `c186` , `c641`). If you start the same container twice, it will
get a new category the second time ( a different category than it had the first
time). The category system isolates containers from one another.

Types can be applied to processes and to files.

Imagine a system where we define types on objects like cats and dogs. A cat and
dog are process types:

- Cat
- Dog

image::selinux1.png[Processes]

We have a class of objects that they want to interact with which we call food.
And I want to add types to the food;

- cat_food
- dog_food

image::selinux2.png[Objects]

As a policy writer, we would define that a dog has permission to eat dog_chow
food and a cat has permission to eat cat_chow food. In SELinux we would write
this rule in policy.

- allow cat cat_chow:food eat;
- allow dog dog_chow:food eat;

image::selinux3.png[Objects]

With these rules the kernel would allow the cat process to eat food labeled
cat_chow and the dog to eat food labeled dog_chow.

And processes and objects are happy.

image::selinux4.png[Objects]


But in a SELinux system everything is denied by default. This means that if the
dog process tried to eat the cat_chow, the kernel would prevent it.
