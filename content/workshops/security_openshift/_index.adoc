== Overview

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Containers, whether you have used them or not. We are going to start with a short overview (yes, slideware) and then we’ll get into the lab as soon as possible. That is where we will spend most of our time.

=== Your Responsibilities

Have a discussion. This will be boring if it’s just us up here talking for over 4 hours.
Participate. We are going to cut you loose with Containers here in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.
Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please ask an instructor for a laptop.
